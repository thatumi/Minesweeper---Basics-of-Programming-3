I created this program as a project for the "Basics of Programming 3" course (Budapest University of Technology and Economics).

This is an enhanced version of Minesweeper, which means that it has a countdown timer at the bottom of the game field. The objective is to complete the game within the given time frame while avoiding two types of mines: the familiar "game over" mines, and a "time bomb" that only deducts from the timer. You can save your game progress using the F5 key and load it back from the menu. Additionally, there is a high scores table.

The program also includes some JUnit tests and an UML diagram.
